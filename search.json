It is helpful to divide a workflow into three phases:\n\nPlan, collect and clean\nExplore, model and validate\nCommunicate, reproduce and deploy\n\nLet’s use an example with the Gapminder data set\nPhase One: Plan, Collect, Clean\nThe planning part consists of asking what you want to achieve and then refining how you do that.\nOnce an EDA is complete, a natural model to use first is linear regression.
