👋 Hi, I’m JT, aka @DSD-resilience, because resilience is a one of the key values of my digital products firm, DSD.

👀 I’m interested in AI-ML, Shiny apps, statistics, and cyber resiliency.

🌱 I’m always learning more R, Python and SQL.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Shiny apps for enterprise, dashboards for strategic insights, statistical analysis and data cleaning.

📫 How to reach me: millerauthor@datascientistdude.com for business inquiries please.
