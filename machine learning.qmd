**Machine learning** (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

ML projects can benefit from a standardized work flow. I divide my work flow into three phases:

Conduct EDA on Gapminder data set

Once an EDA is complete, a natural model to use first is linear regression. (project each for regression, classification and clustering)
