**Machine learning** (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

A standardized work flow leads to better outcomes. It is helpful to divide a workflow into three phases:

1.  Plan, collect and clean

2.  Explore, model and validate

3.  Communicate, reproduce and deploy

**Phase One:** Plan, Collect, Clean

Once an EDA is complete, a natural model to use first is linear regression. (project each for regression, classification and clustering)
