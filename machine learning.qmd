**Machine learning** (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

1.  Plan, collect and clean

2.  Explore, model and validate

3.  Communicate, reproduce and deploy

Let's use an example with the Gapminder data set

The planning part consists of asking what you want to achieve and then refining how you do that.

Once an EDA is complete, a natural model to use first is linear regression. (project each for regression, classification and clustering)

**Phase Two:**
