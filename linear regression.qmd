## 🌍 Introduction

This report investigates the relationship between a country’s GDP per capita and its average life expectancy using linear regression. Data is sourced from the **Gapminder dataset**.

## 📊 Data Overview

The Gapminder dataset tracks global development indicators across countries and over time. It was popularized by Hans Rosling and the Gapminder Foundation to promote a fact-based worldview using animated data visualizations.

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves using various statistical and visual methods to understand the main characteristics of this dataset.

## 📈 Linear Regression Model

## 📉 Diagnostic Plots

## 🧠 Interpretation

**Intercept**: Average life expectancy at log(GDP) = 0.

**Slope**: Life expectancy increases by \~`r round(coef(model)[2], 2)` years for each unit increase in log(GDP per capita).

**R-squared**: `r round(summary(model)$r.squared, 2)` indicates the proportion of variance explained.

## ⚠️ Limitations

GDP is not the only factor.

Social, environmental, and political factors are omitted.

Outliers and skew can influence the model.

## ✅ Conclusion

This model suggests a strong relationship between economic wealth and life expectancy, though causality cannot be inferred from this analysis alone.
