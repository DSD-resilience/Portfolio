## 🌍 Introduction

This report investigates the relationship between a country’s GDP per capita and its average life expectancy using linear regression. Data is sourced from the Gapminder dataset.

## 📊 Data Overview

```{r}
data <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)

summary(data)
```

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "darkgreen") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita",
       x = "GDP per Capita (log scale)",
       y = "Life Expectancy")
```

## 📈 Linear Regression Model

```{r}
model <- lm(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), data = data)
summary(model)
tidy(model)
```

## 📉 Diagnostic Plots

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model)
```

## 🧠 Interpretation

**Intercept**: Average life expectancy at log(GDP) = 0.

**Slope**: Life expectancy increases by \~`r round(coef(model)[2], 2)` years for each unit increase in log(GDP per capita).

**R-squared**: `r round(summary(model)$r.squared, 2)` indicates the proportion of variance explained.

## ⚠️ Limitations

GDP is not the only factor.

Social, environmental, and political factors are omitted.

Outliers and skew can influence the model.

## ✅ Conclusion

This model suggests a strong relationship between economic wealth and life expectancy, though causality cannot be inferred from this analysis alone.
